Now that we have variables for title and days of the week, we can begin writing to our new file. First, we need to specify the location of the file. Again, we will use the directory /users/sammy/. We will have to specify the new file we wish to create. So, our path will actually be /users/sammy/new_days.txt. We provide our location information in the new_path variable. We then open our new file in write mode, using the open() function with the 'w' mode specified.
